# ðŸ›¡ PNPM + Socket.dev Security Check

This GitHub Action runs `pnpm audit` and `socket protect` to detect:
- Known vulnerabilities (`pnpm audit`)
- Suspicious or malicious packages (`Socket.dev`)
- Risky install scripts or obfuscated code

If issues are found, it:
- Comments the results on the pull request
- Fails the build to block merging
